# CTF scripts
Useful scripts and little hacks I use and create while playing CTFs.

## Currently supported shells
Some scripts that rely on the shell, like add-to-path, create-alias and create-ctf, are only working in:
 - bash
 - fish

But it shouldn't be difficult to execute those manually.

Feel free to add suggestions and other lil utilities.
